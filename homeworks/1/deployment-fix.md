### Problem Overview
Pod fails to schedule due to untolerated node taint, specifically the `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized` taint.

### Resolution Steps
1. Inspect the Deployment and Pod
First, examine the deployment and pod details to identify the issue:

```bash
sudo kubebuilder/bin/kubectl describe deploy demo
sudo kubebuilder/bin/kubectl describe pod demo-dfdb5969b-7qxqw
```

2. Verify that scheduling filed
Look for the `FailedScheduling` event in the pod description. You should see output similar to:

```
Events:
  Type     Reason            Age   From               Message
  ----     ------            ----  ----               -------
  Warning  FailedScheduling  38s   default-scheduler  0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had untolerated taint {node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized: true}. preemption: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.
```

3. Add Toleration to the Deployment
Edit the deployment to add a toleration:
```bash
sudo kubebuilder/bin/kubectl edit deploy demo
```

Under `spec.template.spec`, add the following toleration configuration to tolerate the existing taint:
```yaml
tolerations:
  - key: "node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

4. Verify the Fix
Confirm that the deployment has recreated the pod with the updated configuration:
```bash
sudo kubebuilder/bin/kubectl get pods
```
Expected output:
```
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
demo-dfdb5969b-7qxqw   1/1     Running   0          24s
```

### Summary
By adding a toleration for the `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized` taint, the pod can now be scheduled 
successfully on node with this taint, resolving the scheduling issue.
